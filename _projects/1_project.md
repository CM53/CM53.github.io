# SARS‑CoV‑2 Duplexed RT‑RPA with Lateral‑Flow Readout & Full Process Control

## What I did:
Developed a one-pot, duplexed RT‑RPA assay for SARS‑CoV‑2 featuring both real-time fluorescence and lateral-flow strip detection. The assay includes an RNA-based MS2 internal control to verify lysis, reverse transcription, and amplification—providing full process validation from sample to signal.

## Key innovations:

- High sensitivity: Limit of detection of 25 copies/reaction via fluorescence and 50 copies/reaction via lateral flow in under 25 minutes.

- Full workflow control: MS2 bacteriophage control flags failures across the assay, reducing false negatives.

- Variant robustness: Accurately detects Delta and Omicron variants with no cross-reactivity to other common respiratory viruses.

- Point-of-care compatibility: Uses lyophilized reagents and minimal hardware (heat block, body heat, etc.), making it field-deployable.

- Meets WHO criteria for rapid COVID-19 diagnostics.

## Imaging & analysis software:
I developed custom imaging software to automatically locate, analyze, and quantify band intensities from lateral-flow strips using flatbed scanner images. The tool extracts spatial and intensity data for each test and control line, enabling consistent and objective result interpretation for large-scale or field deployments.
