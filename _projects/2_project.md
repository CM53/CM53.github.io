# Low-Cost Imaging Systems for Fluorescence-Based Diagnostics

I developed two low-cost, image-based diagnostic platforms designed for fluorescence detection in point-of-care and resource-limited settings.

## ðŸ§ª Raspberry Piâ€“Based Fluorescence Reader
Built a compact diagnostic imaging system using **off-the-shelf components for under $300**. The device integrates:
- A Raspberry Pi with a custom Python interface,  
- FAM-channel fluorescence imaging using high-intensity LED excitation,  
- Custom optics and spectral filtering for precise emission isolation.

The system supports real-time image capture and processing, enabling sensitive, low-cost molecular diagnostics outside traditional lab environments.

## ðŸ“± Mobile App for Fluorescence Imaging* 
Developed an Android application that leverages native camera APIs to enable direct control of:
- Shutter timing,  
- Flash intensity and duration,  
- Manual exposure settings.

This provides a software-controlled mobile platform for fluorescence imaging without additional hardware, ideal for field diagnostics, test strip reading, or training datasets.
