# Chip-Based Quantification of Isothermal Amplification Using Tunable Crowding Chemistry

We developed a low-cost, membrane-free microfluidic platform for quantitative nucleic acid amplification using Amplification Nucleation Site Analysis (ANSA)â€”a technique that correlates discrete fluorescent amplification sites with input DNA concentration. This study investigates how the viscosity of the reaction mixture, tuned via polyethylene glycol (PEG), impacts the growth, shape, and spacing of amplification sites.

## ðŸ§ª Key Contributions:
- Microfluidic ANSA chip fabricated using laser-cut tape, PETG, and glassâ€”no droplet generators or lithography required.
- PEG concentration modulates site size, growth kinetics, and spacing, enabling precise tuning of quantifiable range.
- With a custom buffer PEG solution, ANSA quantifies HIV-1 DNA from 20 to ~10,000 copies/reaction, a 5-log dynamic range.
- Fluorescence sites follow a Gaussian profile whose growth transitions from exponential to diffusion-limited over time.
- Image analysis using real-time microscopy and Python-based processing pipeline extracts site counts and diameters with theoretical modeling confirming the role of Fickian diffusion in later growth stages.

## ðŸ”¬ Why It Matters:
This work significantly expands the quantitative capability of isothermal NAATs for point-of-care testing. By using viscous crowding chemistry, ANSA achieves PCR-like performance without the complexity of droplet microfluidics or thermocyclers. The method offers a scalable and field-deployable platform for viral load quantification in HIV diagnostics, and can be adapted for other pathogens.
