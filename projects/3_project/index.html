This study investigates how the viscosity of the reaction mixture, tuned via polyethylene glycol (PEG), impacts the growth, shape, and spacing of amplification sites.</p> <h2 id="-key-contributions">ðŸ§ª Key Contributions:</h2> <ul> <li>Microfluidic ANSA chip fabricated using laser-cut tape, PETG, and glassâ€”no droplet generators or lithography required.</li> <li>PEG concentration modulates site size, growth kinetics, and spacing, enabling precise tuning of quantifiable range.</li> <li>With a custom buffer PEG solution, ANSA quantifies HIV-1 DNA from 20 to ~10,000 copies/reaction, a 5-log dynamic range.</li> <li>Fluorescence sites follow a Gaussian profile whose growth transitions from exponential to diffusion-limited over time.</li> <li>Image analysis using real-time microscopy and Python-based processing pipeline extracts site counts and diameters with theoretical modeling confirming the role of Fickian diffusion in later growth stages.</li> </ul> <h2 id="-why-it-matters">ðŸ”¬ Why It Matters:</h2> <p>This work significantly expands the quantitative capability of isothermal NAATs for point-of-care testing. By using viscous crowding chemistry, ANSA achieves PCR-like performance without the complexity of droplet microfluidics or thermocyclers. The method offers a scalable and field-deployable platform for viral load quantification in HIV diagnostics, and can be adapted for other pathogens.</p> <hr> <h2 id="-citation">ðŸ“„ Citation:</h2> <p>Martin, C.D., Gummalla, N.S., Shimazu, K.N., Bender, A.T., Posner, J.D.<br> The Role of Viscous Crowding Agents on Dynamics and the Quantifiable Range of Isothermal Amplification Nucleation Site Analysis<br> Analytical Chemistry, 2024 (Prepared)</p> <hr> <h3 id="-pdf">ðŸ“¥ PDF:</h3> <p>shared when published</p> </body></html>
