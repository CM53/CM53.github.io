I’m a PhD chemical engineer with expertise in microfluidics, molecular diagnostics, isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and computer vision. My research has focused on designing accessible, low-cost point-of-care tests for infectious diseases like HIV and SARS-CoV-2.

I developed a duplexed RT-RPA assay with lateral flow and fluorescence readouts meeting WHO guidelines, and designed a minimalist microfluidic chip for quantitative diagnostics using first-principles fluid mechanics. I also built a mobile phone–based imaging pipeline and applied deep learning (ResNet-18) to quantify and model amplification dynamics in HIV assays.

I’m driven by the challenge of applying the best tools whether molecular, computational, or mechanical to solve impactful problems in health and engineering. My work bridges diagnostics, device design, and data science to move technologies from the benchtop to real-world use.
